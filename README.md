# Java Spring Boot application for interfacing a smarthome

This repository contains a Spring Boot application that was part of my BSc degree project.
The application provides an interface to control several MCUs that are responsible
for controlling some smarthome functions via MQTT protocol.

The Spring Boot app has an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. 

I deployed the application on a Raspberry Pi 3B+, and it was available on the web.
